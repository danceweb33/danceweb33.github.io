		<p>Ballet is a genre of dance that refines technique, your mind, and your body. This is a great fundamental class to take, even if you don't plan on sticking with it later. Most other genres have roots in ballet, so it is a great class to start with and stick with. For ballet you must wear a leotard of your choice and tights. You also must wear ballet shoes.</P>
