	<h1>Performances</h1>
	<img class="dance" src="images/ballet9.webp" alt="Ballet9">
	<p>Center Line Dance Company puts together a performance once a year in the spring to show the improvement of all our dancers willing to participate in our anual recital. This performance is optional, but highly recommended for each student to show their sparkling improvement to their loved ones. The recitals are always on a Sunday with two shows: matinee and evening. We also ask for volunteers that are willing to help with costumes, food, changing room business, etc.</p>

	<h1>Common Questions Asked</h1>
	<p>The following are common questions that we get from those interested in our company:</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>Do you go to conventions and participate in competitions?</dt>
		<dd>No, we do not participate in competition conventions. This studio is less competative and more for the fun of dance and movement. It's a great place to form bonds and friendships, not compete against your peers and create an evironment with tension.
		</dd>
		
		<dt>Are we supposed to buy our costumes for the shows, or are the costumes provided by the studio?</dt>
		<dd>It depends on the dances and age group, but we tend to reuse costumes because it's more cost friendly and better for the environment. However, there are some occasions where new costumes are needed to be bought by the dancer using them.
		</dd>
		
		<dt>How are classes arranged? By age? By skill?</dt>
		<dd>There are 3 different categories: A(adults), B(babies), and C(children). Each category has multiple levels that people are placed in considering age, experience, and skill. People must participate in a placement test in order for the teachers to evaluate and place each person in a level.
